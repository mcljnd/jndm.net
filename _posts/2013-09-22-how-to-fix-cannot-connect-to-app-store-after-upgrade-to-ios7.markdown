After upgrading my iPad 3 and iPhone 5 to iOS7 I noticed that I cannot install any app from App store. I was able to update existing apps, but when I trid to search for some not installed I got a message **“Cannot Connect to App Store“**.

At first I thought it is because App store is overloaded, but after few days it was still the same. I have tried everything, sign out from App store, restart iPad/iPhone, but with no success. I was able to search App store from iTunes on my PC, so App store itself was working.

As a Window user, where reboot is king:-) I tried hard reboot and **it worked!**

So how to fix that **“Cannot Connect to App Store”** error? When iPad/iPhone is running press and hold both, Home and Power button untill it turned itself off. Device is then hard rebooted and App store is working. My iPhone rebooted automatically, iPad I had to turn with power button.
